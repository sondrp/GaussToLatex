# Gauss-Jordan Elimination Latex generation

A very specific tool that allows you to generate the latex for Gauss-Jordan elimination. 
Can save some time and annoyance when writing reports with lots of matrix operations, since writing these by hand can take away time from the important parts.

This project follows the golden rule of engineering: "Why spend x units of time doing a manual task when you can spend 10x units of time automating it?"

Features:
- Create a matrix with string values.
- "Fork" the matrix to make the next operation step (can be done from any step).
- Swap rows by dragging and dropping.
- Create a new line by clicking on the arrows (top right preview)

Note that if the matrices seem to overflow in a strange way, you need to click on an arrow to make a new line.

Missing features:
- Fractions (\frac{}{})
- Multiply / add constant to a row
- Change order of matrices.
